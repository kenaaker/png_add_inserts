png_add_inserts
===============

This is something to add image insertion point text strings to png image files.

I'm going to add the image insertion points as iTxt chunks, with a syntax that is reminiscent of X-Windows and ImageMagick geometry strings.

widthxheight+xoffset+yoffset/rotation_angle

The rotation angle is my own sillyness.
